      <p>
        Ants are eusocial insects of the family Formicidae and, along with the related wasps and bees, belong to the
        order Hymenoptera. Ants appear in the fossil record across the globe in considerable diversity during the latest
        Early Cretaceous and early Late Cretaceous, suggesting an earlier origin. Ants evolved from vespoid wasp
        ancestors in the Cretaceous period, and diversified after the rise of flowering plants. More than 13,800 of an
        estimated total of 22,000 species have been classified. They are easily identified by their geniculate (elbowed)
        antennae and the distinctive node-like structure that forms their slender waists.

        Ceratophrys is a genus of frogs in the family Ceratophryidae. They are also known as South American horned frogs

        character Pac-Man.

        Scutigera coleoptrata, also known as the house centipede, is a species of centipede that is typically
        yellowish-grey and has up to 15 pairs of long legs. Originating in the Mediterranean region, it has spread to
        other parts of the world, where it can live in human homes. It is an insectivore; it kills and eats other
        arthropods, such as insects and arachnids.

      <p>
        Wolf spiders are members of the family Lycosidae (from Ancient Greek λύκος (lúkos) 'wolf'). They are robust and
        agile hunters with excellent eyesight. They live mostly in solitude, hunt alone, and do not spin webs. Some are
        opportunistic hunters, pouncing upon prey as they find it or chasing it over short distances; others wait for
        passing prey in or near the mouth of a burrow.

      <p>
        The Pholcidae are a family of araneomorph spiders. The family contains over 1,800 individual species of
        pholcids, including those commonly known as cellar spider, daddy long-legs spider, carpenter spider, daddy
        long-legger, vibrating spider, gyrating spider, long daddy, and skull spider. The family, first described by
        Carl Ludwig Koch in 1850, is divided into 94 genera.

        The common name "daddy long-legs" is used for several species, especially Pholcus phalangioides, but is also the
        common name for several other arthropod groups, including harvestmen and crane flies.

      <h2 class="ui-bar ui-bar-a">Roach</h2>
      <img class="bugs" src="img/roach.jpeg" alt="some dude in a roach costume" height="400">
      <p>
        Cockroaches (or roaches) are insects of the order Blattodea, which also includes termites. About 30
        cockroach species out of 4,600 are associated with human habitats. Some species are well-known as pests.

        The cockroaches are an ancient group, with ancestors originating during the Carboniferous period, some 300–350
        million years ago. Those early ancestors, however, lacked the internal ovipositors of modern roaches.
        Cockroaches are somewhat generalized insects lacking special adaptations (such as the sucking mouthparts of
        aphids and other true bugs); they have chewing mouthparts and are likely among the most primitive of living
        Neopteran insects. They are common and hardy insects capable of tolerating a wide range of climates, from Arctic
        cold to tropical heat. Tropical cockroaches are often much larger than temperate species. Contrary to popular
        belief, extinct cockroach relatives (Blattoptera) and 'roachoids' such as the Carboniferous Archimylacris and
        Apthoroblattina were not as large as the biggest modern species.

        Some species, such as the gregarious German cockroach, have an elaborate social structure involving common
        shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition. Cockroaches have appeared in human culture
        since classical antiquity. They are popularly depicted as dirty pests, although the majority of species are
        inoffensive and live in a wide range of habitats around the world.
      </p>
      <h3>Care</h3>
      <p>Food: Anything. Diapers, bones, and fresh fruit</p>
      <P>Temp: Anything from nuclear winter to nuclear explosion should be fine.</P>
      <p>Other: Gross!!</p>
